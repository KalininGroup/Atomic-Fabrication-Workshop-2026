<p>The workshop is designed to explore research opportunities in quantum information based on emerging approaches including silicon and semiconductor-based qubits, macromolecules, conjugated molecular systems, and other experimental realizations. Workshop topics will include both top-down fabrication techniques and bottom-up methods that can offer atom-by-atom assembly for selected materials, ranging from sequential low-throughput approaches to higher-throughput methods enabled by classical semiconductor workflows and synthesis. The proposed workshop will help sketch a roadmap for atomic-scale fabrication towards novel quantum technologies.

<p>The workshop will serve as a forum to engage traditionally separate communities whose common goal is to build quantum structures with near- and atomically precise fabrication and assembly in currently non-standard materials. It will aim to address relatively less explored approaches to quantum information that are now enabled via advances via ML/AI, synthesis, and ion, electron, and beam probes. Silicon based approaches will center around nuclear spins as well as electron spins.  Nuclear spins of donor atoms such as phosphorus and arsenic will require manipulation at the atomic scale and fundamental research in manufacturing methods that will accomplish this. Electron/hole spin-based approaches will utilize silicon as well as other semiconductors such as carbon nanotubes. Fabrication technologies that are at the nanometer scale will need to be further developed. Macromolecules, and organic systems more generally, are an exciting area of research that combines materials research, precise manipulation at molecular length scales, and studies of spin and quantum light generation. Both soft (organic) and hard matter (e.g. carbon nanotube) pi-electron systems will feature in the workshop. One additional outcome that is expected from the workshop is in fostering a collaborative ecosystem across multiple disciplines empowered to translate academic breakthroughs into scalable, real-world quantum technologies.

<p>The workshop topics and speakers will be selected to be of interest to several NSF divisions and offices including CMMI and ECCS (in ENG), DMR (in MPS), and the Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities.
